# A\*PA2 evals

This directory contains the evals for the A\*PA2 paper.

- `experiments/` contains `.yaml` files with experiment configurations, roughly
  corresponding to the plots in the paper. (Some `.yaml` files are the source of
  multiple plots.)
- Use `just download_results` to download and extract the `results.zip` from the
  [`astarpa2-evals` release](https://github.com/pairwise-alignment/pa-bench/releases/tag/astarpa2-evals) on github.
- Alternatively, `just release` reruns all experiments locally, but be aware that
  this takes a long time (~8 hours). You could make things faster by running
  more in parallel (add e.g. `-j 5` to the `run` rule in `makefile`), or by
  lowering the number of sequences tested (e.g. lower `total_size` in `experiments/*.yaml`).
- `evals.ipynb` contains all plots and other statistics presented in the paper
  from the `results/*.json` files generated by one of the two steps above.
