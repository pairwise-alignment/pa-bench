# A\*PA evals

This directory contains the evals for the A\*PA paper.

- `experiments/` contains `.yaml` files with experiment configurations, roughly
  corresponding to the plots in the paper. (Some `.yaml` files are the source of
  multiple plots.)
- Use `make download_results` to download and extract the `results.zip` from the
  [`astarpa-evals` release](https://github.com/pairwise-alignment/pa-bench/releases/tag/astarpa-evals) on github.
- Alternatively, `make run` reruns all experiments locally, but be aware that
  this takes a long time (1-2 days). You could make things faster by running
  more in parallel (add e.g. `-j 5` to the `run` rule in `makefile`), or by
  lowering the number of sequences tested (e.g. lower `total_size` in `experiments/*.yaml`).
- `evals.ipynb` contains all plots and other statistics presented in the paper
  from the `results/*.json` files generated by one of the two steps above. The
  version in the repo should correspond to the latest executed version and include all plots.

note: the git history of the `evals.ipynb` file has been squashed to reduce the
size of the repo.
